# T4 dormant WB received-DTO shadow acceptance

Baseline c125a54, accepted guard4860c53 and lossless0065/writer0ce0517.
This is domain composition only: no existing route, scheduler, provider or flag
is activated. Avito is not implemented by this WB-only slice.

`begin_review_shadow` owns an Engine-bound root, captures live membership for a
trusted authenticated ActorContext, checks fixed reviews:write through the shared
guard and commits the run reservation before the caller fetches. The internal
ticket binds principal, exact account/credential authority, source request and run.
It is not a bearer token or a client-deserializable authentication request.

`publish_received_review_rows` accepts the already received tuple of WbFeedbackRow,
uses another guarded root, normalizes without another provider request and writes
through command_savepoints=False. Receipt is returned after successful commit.
Partial page evidence never removes absent reviews. Reservation order fences late
unknown-time responses. Repeated identical publication is idempotent; a changed
same-run payload conflicts. Lossless Unicode/NUL and semantic hashes remain intact.

New 19 actual disposable PostgreSQL cases passed in4.74s. Combined Review/adjacent
and shared-guard set: **641 passed in48.76s**, no skips, natural exit0. This is not
the entire backend suite. Scoped Ruff, compileall and git diff --check exit0.
Tests use the existing scrubbed Unix-only sandbox harness and fresh random owned
databases/roles with fixture cleanup verification, not an application database.

Evidence includes real paired synthetic credential resolution; committed reservation
before a single fake fetch; unchanged raw DTO; new transaction reads/replay; partial
and late response; post-fetch session/membership/scope/account/credential revocation;
stale actor permission denial; malformed ticket/payload rejection; caller Connection
rejection without committing its root; and both actual session-revocation lock-winner
orders checked through PostgreSQL blocking PIDs. No network/provider/LLM is invoked.

Independent scoped critic found no important defect. The commit-error test injects
an exception in SQLAlchemy's pre-physical-COMMIT event: it proves sanitized error and
rollback for that injection, NOT unknown-result network/driver commit recovery.
Running reservations remain after failed fetch/publication; automatic recovery and
failed-run finalization are not implemented. A process restart is not simulated.

Remaining wiring gates: accepted T1 physical-transaction guard follow-up; approved
Review-specific default-off exact org/account selector; actual trusted manual HTTP
principal and explicit account selection; paired secret used by the actual fetch;
same received DTO also consumed by legacy without extra fetch. Do not reuse collector
flags or fabricate the scheduler principal. No public canonical read API in this slice.
Local policies/send/notifications still await their accepted DDL and domain services.

Rollback: this dormant module can be removed without changing existing routes.
The underlying lossless writer rollback must retain decoder-capable dab11ec and
expanded0065; old TEXT-only binaries/schema downgrade are not a valid rollback.

## Physical-guard integration checkpoint

T1 controller-approved8338ef7 lineage merged as2dc09de. Static independent T4
integration review found no introduced incompatibility: own Engine-bound roots,
no savepoints, safe error mapping and return-after-commit remain aligned.

The expanded eight-file run is **not green**:314PASS/20setupERROR37.28s.
Credential SQLite fixture test_marketplace_credential_store.store_db uses global
Base.metadata.create_all; collection of Review ORM adds PostgreSQL JSONB coverage,
which SQLite cannot compile. Minimal collection-only witness (shadow test file plus
credential-fetch file, selecting only test_paired_fetch_exact_identity_and_closed_session)
gives1ERROR/38deselected0.74s; that same credential test alone gives1PASS0.48s.
This is evidence of fixture metadata contamination, not a waived baseline or a
proven runtime guard defect. Exact reproduction sent to T1, who owns that fixture;
no SQLite type weakening, skip or shared-file patch by T4. Combined acceptance
must be rerun after the owner-supplied fix. Review selector still pending/off.

## Fixture blocker closed with actual Review collection

Exact T1 controller-approved34b5f62 was cherry-picked as79f83b9, preserving its
test-only patch and avoiding unrelated pending approvals migration ancestry.
The same runtime fixture patch-id is0bfa989ee0226f69b82f8392985e22902e406849.
All eight original files were retained and credential-store/fixture-isolation
files added: **349 passed in27.69s** with Review files first, and **349 passed
in31.46s** with the entire file list reversed. Both exited0 with no skips and
the actual Review ORM loaded. The original20setup errors are resolved for this
mixed gate; no exclusion or JSONB/schema weakening. This is not a full backend run.

Ordered file list (second run exactly reversed), from backend:
test_review_shadow_service.py, test_review_publication_repository.py,
test_publication_guard.py, test_publication_guard_postgres.py,
test_marketplace_account_context.py, test_marketplace_account_context_postgres.py,
test_marketplace_credential_fetch.py, test_marketplace_credential_fetch_postgres.py,
test_marketplace_credential_fixture_isolation.py, test_marketplace_credential_store.py.
All under tests/, using the same scrubbed Unix-only sandbox/disposable DB harness
as the failed run. Fixture cleanup checks ran on natural completion.

New-fixture Ruff, both fixture compileall and diff-check exit0. T1's four unchanged
legacy-file Ruff findings remain disclosed in its handoff, not a whole-lint PASS.
T1 independent review approved the exact patch; T4 checked the actual diff and
independently ran both mixed orders. Review default-off selector is still pending;
neither HTTP integration nor live/provider/production work has been enabled.
