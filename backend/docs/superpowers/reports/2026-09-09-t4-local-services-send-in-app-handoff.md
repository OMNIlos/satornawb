# T4 — local Review services and next storage interfaces

One implementation-first package; source commit is the commit containing this
report. No shared router registration, live provider, production, flag activation,
schema invention, legacy removal or CodeRabbit. This is not architecture completion.

## Actual runtime implementation

`app/reviews/local_tables.py` explicitly maps the seven T1 tables, in private
metadata; no reflection/create_all/DDL. `local_repository.py` implements four
frozen commands with exact request/result bytes: policy create/select, prepared
draft publication and approve/reject. `local_service.py` owns an Engine-bound
physical PostgreSQL READ COMMITTED transaction and live UserSessionPrincipal
guard, including final guard/commit. Permissions are reviews:write for authoring,
reviews:approve for decisions and reviews:read for context. Client organization
and membership claims must match freshly loaded authority. Account metadata is
read/locked; credentials are not resolved. Exact account GUC is context, not auth.

Receipt lookup precedes current source/policy/head admission. Same actor, intent
bytes and binding returns original committed result after later head changes;
changed actor/intent/binding cannot replay it. A new action takes account → source
FOR SHARE → policy head → workflow head locks. Captured policy epoch/witness,
source observation/checksum, exact current manual predecessor, generation
uniqueness and both head/revision expectations are checked. New drafts clear old
decisions. Unknown answerability permits local drafts/rejection, not approval.
CAS head + immutable entity + audit + completed receipt commit atomically. Errors
roll back the root. No internal commit or success-shaped storage fallback.
Receipt/audit completion is PostgreSQL clock_timestamp, normalized to UTC.

`local_preparation.py` prepares a visibly synthetic fake answer or explicit manual
edit from captured context; no first-draft manual_edit and no real LLM. It returns
immutable canonical command bytes. Prepare once and retain these bytes for
transport retries: this is publication idempotency, not exactly-once generation
or a durable pre-publication generation job. HTTP does not regenerate on retry.

`local_http.py` is dormant; T1/root must explicitly register its router separately:

- POST `/api/v2/reviews/local/commands`: the frozen local command envelope, with
  every version/revision/expected-version represented as a canonical decimal
  string on HTTP. Organization/account/membership remain bounded JSON integers.
  Service canonicalization converts versions to exact integers; raw body is not
  stored as authority. Success is the frozen result envelope, versions as strings.
- GET `/api/v2/reviews/local/context`: required marketplace_account_id/marketplace,
  optional review_id + external_review_id together. Returns selected policy/head,
  optional source/current draft/current decision/workflow head. No account binding
  descriptor, credentials, sendAllowed or raw audit/receipt/request payload.
- Existing default-off exact Review organization/account selector is enforced.
  No UI switch is enabled by merely registering the dormant router.
- 400 invalid,401 unauthenticated,403 denied,404 missing,409 disabled/conflict/
  changed source/policy/not-answerable,503 configuration/storage failure. Errors
  contain fixed codes only. Success/error responses set Cache-Control:no-store.
  Duplicate/unknown request fields and numeric HTTP versions are rejected; default
  validation responses cannot echo private raw command bodies.

`frontend/src/features/wb-reviews/canonicalLocalReviews.ts` is the dormant typed
consumer: closed shapes, exact organization/account/provider and review identity,
decimal-string arithmetic, matched command/result refs, nullable source fields,
no blind retry, no fake approval, no UI/legacy/send cutover. Context may immediately
become stale; only the guarded mutation determines current eligibility.

## Consumed platform chain, unchanged

T1 d57c544 →54386d4 →26752549244eb8b97086d5a140c6cf5c0438ee82 were cherry-picked
as b3d17a2 →7328693 →4f196cd. 0069/0070 are required parents of0071, not resumption
of deferred Production service work. No T4 edits to their migration/runtime ACLs.
T1 labels0071 implemented/integration acceptance pending. These local tests do not
replace the independent platform501/combined integration acceptance.

## Exact next storage codec interfaces — for T1

New `app/reviews/send_payloads.py` uses existing sorted-key, compact UTF-8 JSON,
ensure_ascii=false, no floats/normalization, canonical UUIDs and six-microsecond
UTC timestamps. All key sets below are closed, all nullable fields explicit.
Owner fields mean organizationId/marketplaceAccountId/marketplace; new codec
owner/member IDs are positive INT4, versions exact positive integers, not BIGINT.
Existing `storage_payloads.encode_review_send` is unchanged.

| Encoder | Exact fields beyond owner |
|---|---|
| encode_review_send (existing) | schemaVersion=review-send-request-v1, operationKind=review.answer.create.v1, externalReviewId,draftId,draftRevision,decisionId,bindingChecksum,textChecksum |
| encode_review_answer_evidence | evidenceVersion=review-answer-evidence-v1,evidenceKind,evidenceId,reviewId,commandId,attemptId,outcome,readId,reconciliationStartedAt,observedAt,providerAnswerId,answerChecksum,verifierVersion |
| encode_review_send_audit | Existing review-audit-v1 envelope and exact b17638f send-event matrix, not local-audit encoder; commandId=aggregateId, scoped refs, explicit nullable before/after/reason/actorMembershipId |
| encode_review_enqueue | schemaVersion=review-enqueue-v1,commandId,commandVersion,eventKind=send.ready |

Evidence discriminator dispatch_ack requires null readId/read-start;
reconciliation_read requires UUID readId and read-start<=observed. Incomplete lacks
at least answerID or checksum; exact/different requires both. Provider answer ID
is exact nonblank UTF-8, at most512 characters (existing recovery predicate), not
normalized. Codec does NOT prove provider ownership, dispatch<=read-start,
observed<=DBnow, outcome-vs-command checksum, scoped FKs or authority. Those are
mandatory trusted service and physical admission checks. No raw response/text.

### Resolved lease/reconciliation wording conflict

The original blanket live-lease wording must NOT make existing e4818e3 recovery
unreachable. Claim obtains a future lease; pre-marker renew/dispatch requires
DBnow<lease_expires_at plus exact current attempt/token/version. There is NO renewal
after marker. `evaluate_recovery` waits while the old lease is alive; after expiry,
post-marker recovery uses exact current attempt/token/version, fresh authorized
read/closing authority and verified reconciliation_read. It does not revive the
old lease, create a new send attempt or resend. Missing evidence stays ambiguous.
Fresh permission/account checks still apply; a token or UUID alone is not auth.

Direct ACK closing is only an authenticated current-attempt result while the
dispatch lease is still live. A late ACK after expiry may append immutable ACK
evidence under valid closing authority, but cannot impersonate reconciliation_read
or bypass recovery fencing to close the command. If it cannot satisfy that
authority it performs no write. Subsequent recovery needs a real fresh authorized
read, not fabricated read timestamps on the old ACK. Existing markers/terminal
states never reset because access, policy epoch or credentials changed.

### Account-scoped in-app codec, not external delivery

New `app/notification_storage_payloads.py`:

- `encode_notification_event`: exact schemaVersion=notification-event-v1,eventId,
  organizationId,marketplaceAccountId,scope=account,producer=reviews,entityId,
  sourceVersion,kind,occurredAt,dedupeKey,title,details,severity. Three kinds only:
  approval_required/send_blocked/send_ambiguous. Fixed display/dedupe recomputed
  using existing notification_contract.project_notification; no arbitrary text.
  Approval references draft UUID/revision; other kinds command UUID/version.
  Physical source FK/kind match and source-change/event atomicity remain mandatory.
  No org-wide system event before a real platform registry; no marketplace field
  invented in existing notification identity (account FK determines it).
- `encode_notification_receipt`: exact schemaVersion=notification-in-app-receipt-v1,
  organizationId,marketplaceAccountId,eventId,recipientMembershipId,readAt,
  dismissedAt. At least one timestamp non-null; both independently first-write
  wins, neither implies/reset the other. No artificial timestamp ordering.
- `merge_notification_receipt`: pure same-owner/event/member merge of validated
  existing row and server-authored action; retains every existing non-null field
  even if a retry supplies an earlier timestamp. This is NOT a concurrent UPSERT
  implementation. Physical writer must lock/upsert atomically and revalidate auth.
- `encode_notification_visible_action`: exact schemaVersion=notification-visible-action-v1,
  organizationId,marketplaceAccountId,recipientMembershipId,eventIds,action=read|dismiss.
  Nonempty unique explicit canonical event UUID list. Byte array order retained;
  service must acquire locks in sorted UUID order and authorize ALL IDs before
  any mutation. No high-water, mark-future, unread or reopen. Recipient membership
  is server-derived live authority, not a trusted client field. Event/recipient
  access must be rechecked on every retry; uniqueness is(org,event,membership).

Canonical producer retries must retain original event ID/time/payload. A fresh
different UUID/time under the same dedupe identity is not evidence of an exact
retry; never overwrite the original row. Source receipt/idempotency must prevent
new event generation before lookup. Receipt timestamps come from the guarded DB
transaction, not client clocks. Source versions and first-action timestamps do
not establish production delivery policies.

Literal vectors: `tests/fixtures/reviews/send-in-app-storage-v1-golden.json`, eight
independently frozen UTF-8 JSON/SHA vectors, >BIGINT versions, exact NUL/Unicode,
ack/read/null distinction, enqueue, fixed in-app event and explicit receipt/list.
No new Telegram/email policy, destination, provider receipt, retention or TTL.

## Verification and honest remaining work

Implementation was completed before tests, as directly requested by the user.
Initial local-service/codecs/read gate:91PASS/1FAIL/2warnings9.51s. Isolated diagnostic
reproduced22003 BIGINT overflow3.17s. Actual compiled SQL showed Numeric comparison
with inferred `::BIGINT`; explicit column-typed bind parameters fix that consumer
defect, no schema/policy narrowing. Repeated combined gate:92PASS/2warnings7.92s.
Every allocator-owned database/role was verified absent after cleanup (2+1+2).
No application DB used; OS sandbox allows only local Unix maintenance socket;
all other network denied and sensitive config paths denied.

New codec and adjacent pure suite:287PASS0.23s, all network denied. Frontend10PASS
0.23s and TypeScript build0. Initial frontend runner invocation had conflicting
min/max workers and ran zero tests; matching min/max1 fixed only invocation.
Scoped Ruff and git diff checks passed. Final DB-clock-corrected local service:
17PASS/2warnings4.67s, natural exit0, its additional owned database/role cleanup
verified absent. No active test process, reservation or pending cleanup remains.

Main-agent critical pass checked source/epoch/receipt ordering, ownership, HTTP
integer precision, no audit/private data leakage, deferred Production and absence
of provider actions. The local preflight-critic skill file is unavailable;
CodeRabbit was explicitly excluded. Independent integration review remains root's
gate, not a claim implied by these focused tests.

Remaining: real durable send/attempt/evidence/outbox worker services after T1
storage/authority; atomic in-app event production and receipts after its DDL;
full Review list/history/legacy moderation/prompt parity; durable pre-publication
generation orchestration; actual UI cutover and shared registration; process-
restart/full integration/whole backend acceptance. Existing legacy stays working.
Pure codecs are NOT completion of these services or authorization for a rollout.
