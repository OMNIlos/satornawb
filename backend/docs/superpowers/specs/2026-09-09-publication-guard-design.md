# User-session publication guard design

Status: local implementation decision within the user's all-stage T1 mandate;
no production activation, worker delegation or provider approval. Root coordinator
confirmed permission policy on2026-09-09: Orders service uses fixed `sync:run` for
user-initiated canonical synchronization/publication and fixed `cabinet:read` for
persisted reads. These constants never come from HTTP/client/queue payloads.
Existing membership explicit permissions UNION existing profile permissions remain
authoritative. No permission profile/grants change.

## Chosen approach and alternatives

Use caller-transaction metadata locks and a transaction-bound final validation.
An enqueue-time check cannot fence later revocation; an independent resolver/access
session releases locks before the publication transaction. A new delegation/epoch
schema is unnecessary for this user-session slice and would invent worker policy.
The selected approach costs bounded database lock contention; all network I/O stays
outside the transaction and multiple accounts are locked in ascending ID order.

## Fetch authority capture

Add `credential_store.resolve_marketplace_credential_for_fetch(owner, kind)` returning
`ResolvedCredentialForFetch`, a slots-based redacted/nonserializable envelope with
explicit `.secret` (existing DecryptedCredential) and `.binding` (safe frozen
`CredentialFetchBinding`). The binding contains `owner`, exact `external_account_id`,
exact nullable `credential_ref`, and `credential_identity: CredentialIdentity`.
Identity includes org/account/provider/kind/schema/UUID/generation/expiry, no key
version inventory, nonce or ciphertext. Unknown errors remain typed safe codes.
The new fetch API requires connected canonical account; the old API behavior is
preserved for unchanged consumers. No account-name/latest-organization selection.

One explicit account+active credential joined SELECT supplies both binding and
encrypted row from one PostgreSQL statement snapshot, avoiding mixed account/row
reads. Decrypt that exact row; do not perform a later metadata query to label the
secret. Release the short local session before provider fetch. No provider call,
legacy fallback, raw value serialization, commit of unrelated work or new consumer
switch. Preserve the current resolver's public signature and behavior.

## Publication API

New `app.platform.integrations.publication_guard` exports:

```python
UserSessionPrincipal(organization_id, user_id, membership_id, session_id)
ExpectedAccountBinding(marketplace_account_id, provider, external_account_id, credential_ref)
ExpectedCredential(marketplace_account_id, credential_id, kind, generation,
                   payload_schema_version, expires_at)
ExpectedIngestionToken(marketplace_account_id, token_id, scope, expires_at)
acquire_publication_guard(session, *, principal, required_permissions,
                          accounts, authorities) -> PublicationGuard
PublicationGuard.revalidate_before_write() -> datetime
```

User/session IDs are nonempty strings matching schema limits; org/membership/account
IDs are positive INTEGER-compatible ints, never bool. Provider/kind/schema use the
existing allowlist; UUIDs and aware expiry are exact. `credential_ref=None` requires
NULL, not wildcard. Duplicate/conflicting bindings and authorities are rejected.
Only user-session principal is supported. No worker/admin/session-less/bearer-only
fallback. A verified ingestion token may supplement a user principal, never create
one. Required permissions are a nonempty frozen set supplied by trusted service.
`PublicationGuardError` exposes only one of `publication_context_invalid`,
`publication_access_denied`, `publication_binding_changed`,
`publication_authority_invalid`, `publication_expired`,
`publication_persistence_failed`; unknown codes normalize to persistence failure.
Errors never interpolate SQL, binding metadata, key paths or input fragments.

Principal is captured by trusted service from authenticated ActorContext plus
canonical membership identity before fetch, not accepted from request fields.
The guard freshly matches the expectation against the DB; the dataclass is not
an authentication token. Every credential/token used for fetch must appear in
authorities. Empty authorities are permitted only for a trusted credential-independent
operation such as persisted read; Orders publication service must forbid omission.
Persisted reads use live user/session/membership/account scope, not current credential
availability as a blanket condition. A cursor is not enduring authorization.

## Transaction protocol

Require existing clean, active root SQLAlchemy Session transaction on PostgreSQL
READ COMMITTED, no nested transaction and no pending new/dirty/deleted objects.
Guard never starts another session or commits caller work. Suppress autoflush while
acquiring locks; explicit metadata column projections avoid password/refresh hashes,
verifiers, ciphertext and stale identity-map fields. Reject tenant changes and reuse
on another or ended transaction. Only one guard per root transaction.

Lock order: user SHARE → membership SHARE → login session SHARE → all exact accounts
UPDATE ascending ID → exact credential SHARE sorted(account,kind,UUID) → token SHARE
sorted(account,UUID) → caller's run/projection rows. Re-read after every wait.
User and membership must be active and match org/user/membership IDs. Login session
must match user and be unrevoked/unexpired. Membership permission union and account
scope are fresh. Preserve positive integer/ASCII decimal-string account-list
compatibility; malformed JSON/types deny, never become all-account scope.

Accounts must be connected and match org/provider/external identity/ref. Credential
ID/generation/kind/schema/expiry must match exactly and remain unrevoked. Tokens must
match exact account/provider=avito/UUID/scope `avito.browser_snapshot.write`/expiry
and remain live. New active rows never substitute for revoked old evidence.
Metadata guard performs no decryption, own-session resolver, verifier or network.

Use DB `clock_timestamp()`, not transaction-fixed now(), after lock waits and before
write. A per-session before_commit hook flushes pending caller writes and validates
again after flush waits; validation failure prevents commit. Handle cleanup is tied
to root transaction completion/rollback; caller must roll back failures. Guard checks
must also detect same-transaction metadata/context tampering. No global auth hook
affects sessions that did not acquire a guard. Direct Session.commit cannot silently
omit the final check. No nested/SAVEPOINT use while guarded.

Locks establish which committed operation wins: publisher first may commit before
revoke; revoke first makes publisher abort. Final validation proves expiry at that
validation instant, not an impossible guarantee that time cannot advance between
the last SQL statement and COMMIT. Account binding equality is current-state proof,
not historical A→B→A detection: no approved binding epoch exists. Access-token exp
is not in ActorContext; this slice validates live DB login-session expiry and must
not call it access-token/job-delegation expiry.

## Existing WB writer compatibility

`wb_credentials._binding_candidate(lock=True)` currently locks account then a token
JOIN user with unqualified FOR UPDATE, creating user→account vs account→user cycle.
Repair using metadata-only token owner locator, lock that exact user SHARE first,
then account UPDATE, then token `FOR UPDATE OF lk_user_wb_tokens`; refresh owner,
organization, active status, token/account relationship after waits. If locator
changes, fail closed. Do not merely drop owner lock. Preserve seller verification,
current-token exact comparison and all existing safe behavior, mock provider only.

## Verification and boundaries

RED then GREEN: exact metadata types/permissions/scope/provider/generation/expiry,
redaction, envelope serialization refusal, no secret-column reads, session lifecycle,
same-row capture, final commit enforcement, transaction reuse/nesting/context drift.
Real disposable PostgreSQL: both winner orders for credential/token/user/membership/
session/account revoke; replacement/reencrypt, stale ORM identity map, expiry during
account/metadata/domain-lock waits, final flush expiry rollback, actual WB binder
lock-order race, pool context reuse, rollback on audit/flush/commit failure. Use
barriers/events and actual owned writers where relevant, synthetic rows only.

No schema or migrations, permission expansion, HTTP/router/task/domain edits,
production key access, real provider activity or KIZ/matcher work. Worker delegation,
bearer-only ingestion authority and future historical binding epoch are separate
contracts; none block this user-session implementation. Coordinator receives exact
imports/arguments/tests and remaining limits before T3 wires its own repository.
