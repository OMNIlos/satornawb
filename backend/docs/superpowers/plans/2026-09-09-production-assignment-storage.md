# Production assignment storage implementation plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development or superpowers:executing-plans. TDD and verification-before-completion apply; steps use checkboxes.

**Goal:** Add dormant, account-scoped work-item creation and provable manual SKU assignment storage.
**Architecture:** Three relations with captured OLD/NEW deferred witnesses, inverse continuous-history validation and exact account-serialized idempotency. No domain service or public writer is introduced.
**Tech Stack:** Existing PostgreSQL16/Alembic/SQLAlchemy/pytest and stdlib; own backend/.venv, no dependencies.
**Spec:** `backend/docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-09-production-assignment-storage-design.md`, read fully. Exact T3 authority8a8722f+0aa2c48 and codec72dfacc are cited there.

## Global Constraints

- Only `/Users/bratishka/Downloads/satornawb-main/.worktrees/arch-t1-platform`; no domain Python/ORM/router/task/frontend edits or copying T3 implementation.
- No production/app DB, existing application roles/data, working Redis, providers/network/real credentials/.env, keys/flags, backfill, push/deploy or host configuration changes.
- Only fresh random own databases/runtime roles via existing `tests.test_orders_schema_candidate` allocator. Maintenance postgres only creates/drops/checks exact owned resources over `/private/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432`; no existing app queries.
- Own backend/.venv; env-i PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin, PGPASSFILE/PGSERVICEFILE/NETRC=/dev/null, PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD=1, ORDERS_TEST_USE_LOCAL_CLUSTER=1, plan-owned secret/IP-denying Unix-only sandbox. Alternate Ruff interpreter is lint-only. No skips/xfails/baseline expansion or SQLite RLS substitute.
- Controller amendment after accepted Review binding4d95b24b549f0b1f773095ec583a85f18172fdbc: actual sole head is20260909_0068. Allocate20260909_0069 ONLY if that remains the sole head and0069 is absent at dispatch. If either differs, stop this task for controller graph reconciliation; no silent renumbering. This explicitly supersedes the original conditional0068 candidate, not a reservation against another accepted schema request.
- Heavy PostgreSQL/test/build/browser gates now use the coordinator's single team slot. Read/plan work may proceed; before running RED or any later heavy gate obtain controller confirmation of slot ownership. Do not start a concurrent heavy gate, change timeouts, silently retry a failed full gate, or signal another task's process. Preserve natural exit and owned-resource cleanup evidence.
- No older migration edits. All three new tables FORCE org+account RLS; context is not authorization. Production permission remains an explicit activation gate, never invented here.
- Exactly creation and manual assignment; no source refresh/unassign/planned-quantity changes, automatic mapping, print/artifact/calendar/provider or scheduler behavior.
- Runtime service must separately prove immutable Orders item→parent current run binding, exact live owner and source-version coherence before creation/assignment/replay. Unbound/mismatched history fails closed; this physical schema is not that authentication/provenance service.

## Task 1: Implement the three-relation storage prerequisite

**Files:**
- Create `backend/alembic/versions/20260909_0069_production_assignment.py`.
- Modify `backend/ops/runtime-db-role.sql` only new table/sequence/helper overrides and FORCE-RLS preflight entries.
- Create `backend/tests/test_production_assignment_schema.py`.
- Create `backend/tests/test_production_assignment_lifecycle.py`.
- Create `backend/tests/test_production_assignment_rls.py`.
- Create `backend/docs/superpowers/reports/2026-09-09-t1-production-assignment-schema-handoff.md`.

**Consumes:** accepted spec; existing0062 Orders scoped FK/quantity/version and Catalog/member anchors,0064 account-first discipline, accepted account context2408839 and physical guard8338ef7 as consumer requirements; candidate.cluster/disposable_database/migrate; latest-head runtime script fixture from test_orders_schema_integration. Source codec and exact literal test:
`72dfaccb9e6190234c025f3c96bcfef400ce43b0:backend/app/modules/production.py` and `backend/tests/test_production_assignment_serialization.py` (read only).

**Produces:** production_work_items, production_assignment_receipts, production_assignment_history with exact spec columns/constraints and no extra business states. Immutable fixed-search-path SECURITY INVOKER helpers:

```text
public.production_exact_text(text)->boolean
public.production_ascii_json_string(text)->text
public.production_assignment_bytes(bigint,bigint,integer,text,text)->bytea
# work_item_id,expected_version,catalog_sku_id,idempotency_key,reason
```

- [ ] Read full spec and exact source request/amendment/codec, actual Orders0062 quantity/version/identity guards and parent FK, existing allocator and ACL/downgrade examples. Confirm clean owned paths, exact head and0069 absence before writing. Tests must not import/copy T3 domain code. T3 actual0067 consumer33c95c17+decoder8010112 is accepted as a domain handoff, not a reason to import/copy its implementation here; P1 source-chain/permission acceptance stays separate.
- [ ] Write initial tests against previous0068 before any new DDL. Real PostgreSQL invocation of new helper and new table INSERT must fail UndefinedFunction/UndefinedTable, with an existing Orders unbound positive control. Record command/exit and setup success separately; fixture/import failures are not RED. Then write the remaining invariant tests before implementation.

```python
GOLDEN = b'{"command":{"catalog_sku_id":3,"expected_version":2,"idempotency_key":"synthetic-key","reason":"synthetic-reason","work_item_id":1},"schema_version":1}'
with owner.connect() as c:
    actual, sql_checksum = c.execute(text("SELECT payload, encode(sha256(payload),'hex') FROM (SELECT public.production_assignment_bytes(1,2,3,'synthetic-key','synthetic-reason') AS payload) AS generated")).one()
assert bytes(actual) == GOLDEN
assert sql_checksum == hashlib.sha256(GOLDEN).hexdigest()
```

Additional expectations use Python stdlib JSON independently, not the SQL serializer. Cover edge whitespace (full Python strip set), interior controls, quote/backslash, combining/supplementary Unicode, DEL and exact long distinct/equal text. NUL/unpaired surrogates reject at supported boundary with native client/TEXT restrictions disclosed.
- [ ] Create exact model from spec. Positive generated-always BIGINT physical IDs; existing org/account/member/SKU positive INTEGER; version/source versions BIGINT; quantity INTEGER. TEXT C exact nonempty key/reason with no invented length cap; no text-bearing B-tree unique. Generated remaining quantity, scoped FK targets and nullable org-owned SKU preserved. JSONB request exactly five fields and result exactly seven; BYTEA canonical metadata request with lower-case SHA256 and exact reconstructed-byte equality.

```sql
-- These are different invariants, not aliases for a digest comparison:
CHECK (request_schema_version=1 AND result_schema_version=1),
CHECK (canonical_request_bytes = public.production_assignment_bytes(
  work_item_id, result_version-1, (request_payload->>'catalog_sku_id')::integer,
  idempotency_key, request_payload->>'reason'))
```

Before the CHECK's casts, a BEFORE INSERT validator must check object key sets, JSON types and retained numeric representation/width/range bounds; reject bool/string/retained fractional forms/NULL, require exact request expected=result_version-1 and exact work item/key. Canonical BYTEA requires decimal integer tokens and rejects exponent/fraction spelling even when JSONB is equivalent. JSONB normalizes some exponent tokens before triggers can inspect them: add native characterization of 1e0 versus retained 1.0, and do not claim original lexical rejection from JSONB alone (including result_payload). Raw lexical admission is the trusted decoder's obligation. Do not depend on SQL CHECK evaluation order for safe parsing. No rounding/coercion in validators. Trigger helpers cannot be runtime callable mutation APIs.
- [ ] Implement account-first BEFORE STATEMENT locks for all new-table mutations before tuple locks. Require exact canonical positive org/account context, READ COMMITTED and successful account lookup; missing account lock must reject immediately before any later fresh read (the0067 I1 lesson). Provider belongs to canonical account; both WB/Avito allowed, no fake Catalog account ownership.
- [ ] Creation BEFORE INSERT enforces version1/SKU NULL/planned0/witness NULL, obtains exact source Orders item FOR SHARE after account lock, and validates current positive quantity/version together. Captured deferred INSERT witness repeats comparison at commit; same-transaction source mutation fails, concurrent source mutation waits or yields coherent conflict. Source/identity/quantity/created fields become immutable. No invented order-status readiness predicate.
- [ ] Manual UPDATE changes only SKU/version/time/current receipt witness, version exactly OLD+1, non-NULL new SKU and distinct new witness. Same SKU with a new command is still a version transition. Validate captured OLD/NEW against exact receipt/history at deferred commit, including all seven result values, actor/reason/target and equal command time. Initial creation has no assignment receipt; update cannot commit without one.

```sql
-- Captured rows belong to each event, not only the final current row:
IF NEW.version <> OLD.version + 1
   OR NEW.catalog_sku_id IS NULL
   OR NEW.current_assignment_receipt_id IS NULL
   OR NEW.current_assignment_receipt_id IS NOT DISTINCT FROM OLD.current_assignment_receipt_id
THEN RAISE EXCEPTION USING ERRCODE='23514', MESSAGE='production_assignment_invalid';
END IF;
```

Timestamp protocol: trusted consumer obtains DB clock once after guard/locks and uses that exact finite instant for its work-item mutation/receipt/history. Do not take a caller body timestamp or invent clock-skew tolerance. Schema proves finite/order/equality, not the provenance/authenticity of an arbitrary SQL caller's supplied time. Use DB clock defaults for creation; tests use actual DB time after acquiring locks. A rollback/clock regression may fail closed, never fabricate a future time.
- [ ] Reciprocal receipt/history validators prove no ghost history and every actual transition. For each current work item require unique result versions2..V, countV-1, exact one history per receipt and vice versa, initial previous SKU NULL, adjacent previous/new SKU chain, frozen source/quantities across results and final witness atV. Compare every captured transition separately so valid multi-command transactions pass. Parent/children queue final validation; no private xmin/GUC token shortcut or audit-only claim.
- [ ] Enforce exact scoped idempotency with retained account lock, fresh READ COMMITTED full equality and deferred duplicate rejection. Bounded owner/workitem indexes only; no digest identity or truncation. Test DB-backed test participant using SQL: authorize/context simulated only as test setup, account lock, exact key lookup, old receipt replay before current-version check, new CAS and atomic receipt/history. It is not a new application service or live permission proof.

```python
# Required test outcomes, with separate real sessions and observed blocking:
assert same_version_different_keys == (1, 1)  # one committed CAS, one safe conflict
assert same_key_same_body_counts == (1, 1, 1)  # one transition/receipt/history
assert replay_result == original_frozen_result  # even after a later valid command
assert changed_body_replay_commits == 0
```

Use actual fixture/SQL helpers local to these three tests, concrete safe exception codes and exact post-transaction row assertions. Include long-key same/different-body races, stale version, other org/account/actor/SKU, missing/extra/ghost/history/result/version/time witnesses, multiple valid transitions and replays with no writes. Inject audit/deferred/physical pre-COMMIT failure and prove all three effects rollback; do not claim unknown network COMMIT recovery from an injected failure.
- [ ] FORCE org AND account RLS on all3: no-context/malformed/wrongorg/wrongaccount SELECT empty and INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE denied with positive controls. Privileges independently checked so ACL denial is not passed off as RLS proof. Runtime nonowner/NOSUPERUSER/NOBYPASSRLS; workitems SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE, receipts/history SELECT/INSERT, no DELETE/TRUNCATE/REFERENCES/TRIGGER/schemaCREATE/ownerSETROLE/grantoptions. Identity sequences USAGE only, setval denied. No authentication derived from GUC/actor FK.
- [ ] Narrow only NEW table/column/sequence/function inherited grants to allowed intersection, PUBLIC none/no grant options, limited readers not promoted to writers. Revoke trigger-only helper execution, grant only needed pure helper rights to entitled grantees. Preserve exact old/default ACL snapshots; runtime script new overrides/preflight only, actual script failure must rollback its changes. Test broad defaults, limited-column grants and sequence defaults independently after previous valid head.
- [ ] Downgrade locks all3 in fixed order ACCESS EXCLUSIVE, sets row_security=off as refusal defense and checks truly unfiltered emptiness BEFORE DDL. Visible rows and FORCE-RLS-hidden data each refuse; no CASCADE/delete/truncate to pass. Empty downgrade removes named cyclic constraints/objects in dependency order. Expanded-schema rollback with dormant old binary is documented; no erasure of history.
- [ ] Migration tests separately prove empty chain without stamp and previous-head production-shaped synthetic preservation through upgrade→empty-new-tables downgrade→upgrade. Seed representative old Orders and Reviews (including0065 lossless bytes), retain exact row/ACL snapshots across each step; every asserted seeded relation must be nonempty. Keep historical feature fixture pinned0069, runtime-script fixture follows actual latest head. Graph test accepts one synthetic future successor, not permanently0069-as-globalhead.
- [ ] Run all three files with natural exit under exact scrubbed Unix sandbox, then once adjacent Orders/Reviews/repricer migration gates (select the concrete files below, no full backend expansion):

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -s --tb=short tests/test_production_assignment_schema.py tests/test_production_assignment_lifecycle.py tests/test_production_assignment_rls.py
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q -s --tb=short tests/test_orders_run_binding_migration.py tests/test_orders_run_binding_rls.py tests/test_orders_schema_integration.py tests/test_review_lossless_migration.py tests/test_repricer_approvals_schema.py tests/test_repricer_approvals_lifecycle.py tests/test_repricer_approvals_rls.py
.venv/bin/python -m compileall -q alembic/versions/20260909_0069_production_assignment.py tests/test_production_assignment_schema.py tests/test_production_assignment_lifecycle.py tests/test_production_assignment_rls.py
.venv/bin/python -m alembic heads
git diff --check
```

All listed adjacent filenames were confirmed in the current checkout before plan completion. Report later removal/rename to controller, not silent omission. Scoped Ruff new Python; exact own resource cleanup/absence for success and fault paths. `/dev/null` passfile warnings remain disclosed, no real password-file access. No app/provider/production actions.
- [ ] Self-review exact accepted spec and six-path scope; commit `feat: add scoped Production assignment storage`, report RED/GREEN/commands/exit/cleanup/solehead/DDL API/caller lock-clock-source obligations and unselected permission gates. Independent task review before exact READY T3. Do not implement domain writer or next migration.

## Controller preflight

| Interface | Decision and verification obligation |
| --- | --- |
| exact codec→SQL/BYTEA/JSONB | Fixed72dfacc literal + independent standard-json cases; no T3 code copy or coercion |
| creation→Orders mutable source | Account then exact source SHARE lock, captured deferred consistency; immutable historical owner remains consumer gate |
| mutation→receipt/history | Captured each transition plus inverse continuous chain, valid multi-transition accepted/no ghost |
| long key→lookup | Account-serialized fresh exact equality, no unbounded text B-tree or hash identity |
| runtime grants→RLS | Separate operation rights and dual-context predicates, old/default ACL preservation, sequences USAGE only |
| downgrade→old histories | Allnewtables locked/empty/visible, old rows and ACLs preserved, no destructive bypass |
| code consumer→clock/auth | One trusted DB instant afterlocks, schema validates coherence not user/time provenance; permission remains owner gate |

No other task shares these six write paths during execution. Current queued test-only
harness/package/report gates may run before this schema task; they do not reserve a
revision. Actual head and clean owned scope must be rechecked at dispatch.
